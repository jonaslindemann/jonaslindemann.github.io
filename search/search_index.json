At the time FLTK provided an easy way of implementing an multiplatform application that could run on Windows and Unix/Linux. FLTK provided both an intuitive environment for designing the 2D user interface as well as easy OpenGL context creation. OpenGL context creation on Windows and Unix was implemented very differently on each platform. Having just one way of this enabled ForcePAD to be implemented in a single code base.</p> <p>Using FLTK and OpenGL today has been more problematic. Even though context creation in FLTK is still easy. It is not very flexible preventing new modern OpenGL features from being easily implemented. Also, OpenGL today is a fragmented environment. Apple and macOS are currently not supporting the library and put restrictions on which versions they make available. At this point, I was a bit depressed about the lack of standards in graphics APIs. After I saw a YouTube video on game engines I was impressed with the game library RayLib (https://www.raylib.com/. </p> <p></p> <p>Raylib is a modular game engine that is available on all platforms. When compared to other game engines, Raylib is more of a toolbox where you can use what you need. This is very much the same experience I had with OpenGL a long time ago. The API provides both low-level functions as well as more high-level functions. An example of a very simple RayLib application is shown below:</p> <pre><code>#include \"raylib.h\"\n\nint main() \n{\n    // Initialization\n\n    int screenWidth = 800;\n    int screenHeight = 450;\n\n    InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, \"Simple RayLib Example\");\n\n    SetTargetFPS(60); // Set our game to run at 60 frames-per-second\n\n    // Main game loop\n\n    while (!WindowShouldClose()) \n    {\n        // Draw\n\n        BeginDrawing();\n        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n        DrawText(\"This is RayLib\", 190, 200, 20, LIGHTGRAY);\n        EndDrawing();\n    }\n\n    // De-Initialization\n\n    CloseWindow(); \n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This application will compile for any supported platform, which currently are:</p> <ul> <li>Windows</li> <li>Linux</li> <li>macOS</li> <li>iOS</li> <li>Android</li> <li>Raspberry Pi</li> <li>HTML5</li> </ul> <p>This also means that from the same source code, I can build a native application as well as an application that can be run directly on a web page using web assembly.</p> <p>In the following blog posts, I will try to describe how I set up the basic project and implement the basic abstractions for the application.</p> <p>Until the next blog post...</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/07/19/thoughts-the-forcepad-application/","title":"Thoughts the ForcePAD application","text":"<p>ForcePAD was developed as part of my PhD thesis almost 20 years ago. The application was developed in C++ using OpenGL for graphics and FLTK for the user interface. At the time, it was state-of-the-art and compiled on all platforms, such as Linux, Windows, and SGI Irix 6.5(!). The application was used extensively in teaching and is still used today.</p> <p>The application has been fixed and updated over the years an is available in the Windows app store. However, it is getting harder and harder to compile on both Windows and MacOS due to OpenGL being deprecated on the Mac and being complicated to maintain on Windows. The application would be ideal for running on an iPad, but as it uses OpenGL 1.1, which is not available on the iPad, this is also a dead end. </p> <p>Reflecting on my recent experience with the partial modernization of the older application, ObjectiveFrame, I see a promising path for the ForcePAD application. While the 3D graphics remain a challenge due to the reliance on a large scene graph library using OpenGL 1.1, the potential for modernization is clear. </p> <p>As the ForcePAD application uses a much simpler 2D graphics model, I have decided it is time for a blank sheet instead of a partial rewrite. This also gives me an opportunity to test some new ideas for the application:</p> <ul> <li>Layers for conceptual sketching, </li> <li>Blending</li> <li>Background speculative computations</li> <li>Immediate-mode user interfaces using ImGUI </li> <li>Upgraded multithreaded computational code using the Eigen C++ library. </li> </ul> <p>I will be publishing my development journey regularly on an upcoming blog. I will leave you with a short video with the user interface in its current state.</p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/forcepad/","title":"ForcePAD","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/c/","title":"C++","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/backend/","title":"Backend","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/raylib/","title":"Raylib","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/multiplatform/","title":"Multiplatform","text":""}]}
