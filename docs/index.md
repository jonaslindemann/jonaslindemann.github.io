# Coding thoughts

My name is Jonas Lindemann and I work in HPC where I teach coding in C++, Python and Fortran. I also develop HPC-related software packages (GfxLauncher, ARC Storage Explorer and much more). In my research, I developed several Structural Mechanics applications, primarily for use in conceptual design and teaching.

This blog is an attempt to open up my development process and thoughts to a wider audience and also encourage input. Recently I have started the process of modernizing several of my older applications and also rewriting them with new concepts and ideas. 

Welcome!
